We've included this patched version of prototype-rails in order to remove the following deprecation warning:

DEPRECATION WARNING: ActiveSupport::JSON::Variable is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 4.0. For your own custom JSON literals, define #as_json and #encode_json yourself.

This version replaces ActiveSupport::JSON::Variable with ActiveSupport::JSON::Literal.

See https://github.com/rails/prototype-rails/pull/15

============
prototype-rails provides Prototype, Scriptaculous, and RJS for Rails 3.1.

Prototype and Scriptaculous are provided via the asset pipeline and you
do *not* need to copy their files into your application. Rails will get
them from prototype-rails automatically.

You may want to add them to your app/assets/javascripts/application.js:

    //= require prototype
    //= require prototype_ujs
    //= require effects
    //= require dragdrop
    //= require controls

New applications using this may also want to add

    config.action_view.debug_rjs = true

to their config/environments/development.rb.
